Style Guides
=======================================

A style guide is a collection of conventions for writing for an industry, brand
or project that ensures consistency and clarity by providing a standard to keep
your book, publication or marketing materials from being a mess of
inconsistencies driven by personal preferences.

Most writers will encounter four commonly used guides:

* AP style for journalism
* Chicago style for publishing

* MLA style for scholarly citation (more on each of these below).
