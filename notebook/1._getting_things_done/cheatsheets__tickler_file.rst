=======================================
Tickler File
=======================================

The tickler file is used for things that do not require action any time soon.


Add Task In Far Future
=======================================

Use the Evernote reminder feature to automatically surface long dormat items when they are close
to being due. For example: we have to renew our driver's license in 6 months.

#.  Create new note in GTD/_Tickler notebook
#.  Set reminder for Saturday before due week (so we'll see it Sunday morning during inbox processing)
#.  Once task has been added to Trello Weekly grind board, clear reminder and move to _Cabinet notebook

**Notes:**

*   Reminders are only available in the desktop clients and not in the WUI
*   A List of reminders is shown at the top of the All Notes list and the GTD/_Tickler Notebook
*   Evernote will send an email reminder on the day that the reminder is due
