Code Quality
=======================================

Code Formatters
=======================================

isort

automatically separated into sections and by type.

yapf
---------------------------------------

The ultimate goal is that the code YAPF produces is as good as the code that a
programmer would write if they were following the style guide. It takes away
some of the drudgery of maintaining your code.

yapf will correct a lot of formatting issues before you run pylint...

Static Type Checking
=======================================

mypy
---------------------------------------

Type checkers help ensure that you're using variables and functions in your code
correctly. With mypy, add type hints (PEP 484) to your Python programs, and
mypy will warn you when you use those types incorrectly.
