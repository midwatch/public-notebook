* `Docs <https://classes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_


returns
---------------------------------------

Make your functions return something meaningful, typed, and safe!

Implement logic flows while receiving success and fail results similar to Twisted's
callback/errback results.

Don't have to worry about an unhandled exception crashing a thread/coroutine.
