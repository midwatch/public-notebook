=======================================
Post-Apocalyptic
=======================================

Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic is a subgenre in which a civilization is
collapsing or has collapsed.

How the world ended:

* Alien invasion
* Asteroid strike
* Biological disaster
* Environmental cataclysm
* Judgement day
* Nuclear armageddon
* Rise of the machines
* Rogue planet
* Supernatural invasion


Generation 0
=======================================

In the Generation O era, several decades have passed since the apocalypse. The
oldest survivors can call up childhood memories of the civilized era before the
cataclysm, but most adults were born after the event.


Dark Ages
=======================================

In the Dark Ages era, many generations have passed since the apocalypse(at least
a century, and perhaps several); knowledge of the preapoca- lyptic world has
faded into a mythic history. The ruined cities of the ancients contain
mysteries, dangers, and occasionally treasures, but much of what is left behind
is incomprehensible and useful only as raw materials. The world is a wild and
savage place.



New World
=======================================

In the New World era, legends tell of an ancient civilization that was destroyed
by its own hubris. In the centuries that have passed since, a new form of
civilization—primitive and barbaric though it may be—has begun to take root.
The cities of the ancients are little more than worn-down monu- ments, and only
the rarest of artifacts functions as it did in the time of the ancients.
