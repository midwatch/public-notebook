**Fuzzy String Matching:**

Finding strings that approximately match a pattern in your data using Python.

Fuzzy matching answers the question of "how similar are string A and B?" instead of the Boolean
matching of "Are string A and B the same?"

Fuzzywuzzy is a Python library that uses Levenshtein Distance to calculate the differences betweem
sequences and patterns.
